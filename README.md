SQLite for Jai
==============

this is a module for Jai that allows you to interface with SQLite however works best for you.

***however, this module is still in early development and lacks rigorous testing & some features.***

by `#import`ing `SQLite`, you get access to [bindings for the SQLite C API](src/sqlite3.jai),
as well as [more Jai-friendly wrapper functions](src/SQLite.jai).

*(note that the latter is not an exhaustive port of all SQLite functions, at least, yet)*

you can also `#import "SQLite"(USE_ORM=true);`, which, if you've set up your metaprogram correctly
(see [the example](example/)), allows you to more easily create Jai structs that can automatically
interface with SQLite, like this:

```jai
using SQLite.ORM;

My_Struct :: struct { using model: Model;
    name: string;
    boolean: bool;
    number: int;
    big_num: s64;
    real: float;
    big_real: float64;
    other: Cached(My_Other_Struct);
    private: int; @no_serialize
}
```

all of the members in the above struct, except for the last one, will be automatically de/serialized
to/from your SQLite database, when using [the ORM procedures](src/ORM.jai).

`Cached(My_Other_Struct)` is used for foreign-key references. in the example above, `other` will
serialize to SQL as `other_id`, which will contain the ID of the `My_Other_Struct` that `other`
points to.

there's no need to include your own ID member, as that's included for you in `Model`, along with
`created` and `modified` timestamps. (the timestamps are all handled in SQLite, and, for now,
returned to you in Jai as UNIX timestamps.)

see [the example](example/) for a sample use of this module. note that [example.jai](example/example.jai)
contains the metaprogram, and [src/Main.jai](example/src/Main.jai) contains the actual program.

there is no automatic lazy-loading or anything like that; if you retrieve a `My_Struct` row from the
database, it won't load the associated `My_Other_Struct` into `other` for you. instead, you must
`fetch(*my_struct.other);`.

the basic SQLite wrapper will add a `db` to the `context`, which is the current database connection.

using the ORM will add an additional `db_cache` struct to the `context`, which is a cache of rows
retrieved from the database. you can flush this cache at any time using `flush_cache();`.


TODO
====

 - more compile-time checking of things to make usage more pleasant, e.g. help the user if they forget to `#as` the `using #as model: Model;` in their models
 - figure out what to do about `NULL` values. consider something like `@null_if_default`/`@null_if=value`/`@not_null`...?
 - check the number of query-fragment question marks vs. the number of passed-in parameters at compile time
 - delete most of the code in `select_by_id(T, id)`
 - `update(cached_obj, field_name, value)`
 - `update(T, field_name, value, where, params)`
 - `update(T, field_names, values, where, params)` (...)
 - `delete_from(T, where, params)`
 - `insert(objs)`
 - (...)
 - some way of doing `operator ==` with `Cached(T)`s
 - maybe just huck the SQLite error message into the `context`?
 - maybe have the wrapper functions return enums that are subsets of `Result`? (`#must`...?)
 - more generally, figure out if there's a more ergonomic way to handle SQLite result and/or error passing
 - **add some kind of automatic migration system**â€”we can do SQLite stuff at compile time, so why not?
 - consider whether or not the `ORM` namespace-struct-thing makes sense in the long run
 - actually try this out with slightly non-trivial things like threading and such and see if it actually is good at all lmao
 - finish wrapping the rest of the SQLite API
